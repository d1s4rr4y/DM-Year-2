# Details
[Course Structure](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/courses/dm2meng-2425)
- 2nd Year *MEng* Discrete Maths has [[MA222 - Metric Spaces]] as core, which is not core for *BSc*
	- The core load for *MEng* is 65 CATS
	- The core load for *BSc* is 55 CATS
	- At least 10 CATS must be taken from *Option List A*
	- *Option List B* includes level 2 modules by [Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/), [Mathematics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/currentstudents/ughandbook/year2) and [Statistics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/currentstudents/modules/)
- The list of modules below does not include [ST227 (Stochastic Processes)](https://courses.warwick.ac.uk/modules/2023/ST227-10), nor [ST232 (Introduction to Mathematical Statistics)](https://courses.warwick.ac.uk/modules/2023/ST232-15). Otherwise, all modules from *MEng core* and *Option List A* are below
