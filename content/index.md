# Note

I am not a professor - I cannot ensure the absolute correctness and quality of all of the notes written here. I am not liable for any loss of marks due to information that may be (partially or totally) incorrect here. The reader should check any information they are unsure on the correctness of, and this should not be used as the sole learning resource for any modules. 

If anyone would like to contribute to the site, whether by adding to or correcting any notes I have made, or submitting resources for upload, contact me on discord `@mylifeisinindisarray` and I will update the site (with credit).
