Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ We say that $0, 1,..., m-1$ form a *complete set of residues* module $m$, because they have exactly one representative from each [[1.4 Congruences#^68d73a|congruence class]]. The ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is $\{0, 1, ..., m - 1\}$ equipped with addition and multiplication modulo $m$. It is easy to check that this ring is commutative.

>[!note] Example 1.5.1 (Associativity)
>Let $a, b, c \in \{0,1,..., m-1\}$. We write 
>$$ab = q_1m + r_1, \qquad bc = q_2m+r_2$$ 
>with $0 \le r_1, r_2 < m$. Then 
>$$r_1 c \equiv abc \equiv ar_2 \mod m$$ 
>hence $(ab)c = a(bc) \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ 

**Notation** We will denote the multiplicative group of units (invertible elements) modulo $m$ by ($\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ 

>[!warning] Lemma 1.5.2
>Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ Then $a$ is invertible modulo $m$ if and only if $\gcd(a, m) = 1$.

>>We have $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times} = \{1, 5\} \mod 6$

>>[!note]- Proof

>>The integer $a$ is invertible module $m$ if and only if there exist $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $ax + my = 1$. By [[1.1 Euclid's Algorithm#^bezouts|Bezout's lemma]], such integers exist if $(a, m) = 1$, and conversely if such integers exist then $a, m$ must be coprime.

Hence $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ comprises the [[1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic#^a1320f|coprime]] residue classes modulo $m$. The *Euler totient function $\varphi$* counts the number of coprime residue classes: 
$$\varphi(m) = \#\{a \in \{1, 2, ..., \} : \gcd(a, m) = 1\}$$ Therefore $|(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}| = \varphi(m)$ 

>[!note] Example 1.5.4 
>We have $\varphi(6) = 2$

>[!Warning] Lemma 1.5.5 
>If $p$ is prime, then $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a field, and 
>$$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times} = \{1, 2,..., p - 1\} \mod p$$

>>It is a commutative ring, and any non-zero element is invertible (being [[1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic#^a1320f|coprime]] to the modulus)

>We also denote this by $\mathbb{F}_p$. Note that if $m$ is composite then $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ isn't a field since any prime divisor of $m$ is non-invertible.

**Mod 13 (Card Game)** 
1. Each player is dealt a hand of cards, interpreted as residue classes modulo 13, and two cards $a_1, a_2$ are placed into the centre. 
2. Racing, a player can either play the sum ($a_1 + a_2), product ($a_1a_2$), arithmetic progression ($2a_2 - a_1$) or geometric progression ($a_2^2a_1^{-1}$) as the card $a_3$, declaring what type of move they have made 
3. Play continues with cards $a_2$ and $a_3$ in place of $a_1$ and $a_2$ and so on, until somebody finishes and wins 

>[!note] Example 1.5.7 
>Geometric progression: 7, J, and..? We have 
>$$11 \equiv 24 \equiv 4(-7) \equiv 9 \times 7 \mod 13$$
>so the next card is 
>$$9 \times 11 \equiv 8$$
