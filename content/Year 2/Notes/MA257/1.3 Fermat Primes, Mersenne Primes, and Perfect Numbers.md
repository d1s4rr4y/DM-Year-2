Fermat claimed to have proven that the numbers 
$$F_k = 2^{2^{k}} + 1 \quad (k \ge 0)$$
are all prime. The first 5 of these are prime, but it has since been shown that $F_5,..., F_32$ are composite. The numbers $F_k$ are called *Fermat Numbers* and the prime ones are called *Fermat Primes*

For $p$ prime, denote $M_p = 2^p - 1$. Primes of this form are called *Mersenne primes*. 

The *sum-of-divisors function* is given by 
$$\sigma_1 (n) = \sum_{d \mid n} d$$
where the sum is over positive divisors. A positive integer $n$ is *perfect* if $\sigma_1(n) = 2n$ 

>[!note] Example 1.3.1
>We have $6 = 3 + 2 + 1$, so 6 is perfect. 


An *arithmetic function* is a function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$. An arithmetic function $f$ is *multiplicative* if $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$ holds for any [[1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic#^a1320f|coprime]] positive integers $m$ and $n$  ^44ecc6

>>Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $(m, n) = 1$. Then 
>>$$\sigma_1(mn) = \sum_{d \mid mn} d = \sum_{d_1\mid m} \sum_{d_2\mid n} d_1 d_2 = \sigma_1(m) \sigma_1(n)$$ 

>[!note] Example 1.3.3
>Let $M_p = 2^p - 1$ be a Mersenne prime, and put $n = 2^{p-1} M_p$. Then 
>$$\sigma_1(n) = \sigma_1(2^{p-1})\sigma_1(M_p) = (2^p - 1) 2^p = 2n$$
>So $n$ is perfect. 

>[!warning] Theorem 1.3.4 (Euclid-Euler Theorem)
