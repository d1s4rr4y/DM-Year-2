>>> [!note]- Proof 
>>> 
>>> Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We prove existence by strong induction. For $n = 1$, we use the empty product. For $n > 1$m we may assume that $n$ is composite, so $n = ab$ for some integers $a, b \in (1 < a, b < n)$. By out inductive hypothesis, the integers $a$ and $b$ are the product of primes. Thus, so is $n$. 
>>> For uniqueness, we also use strong induction. If $n = 1$ is expressed as a product of primes, then it must be the empty product, since any other product of primes is at least 2. Now suppose 
>>> $$2 \le n = p_1 ... p_s = q_1 ... q_t$$
>>> for some primes $p_1, ... , p_s$ and $q_1,..., q_t$. By Euclid's Lemma (left), the prime $p_1$ must divide some $q_j$, and therefore must equal $q_j$. By reordering the primes $q_j$, we may assume that $p_1 = q_1$. Now 
>>> $$p_2 ... p_2 = q_2 ... q_t < n$$
>>> So by our inductive hypothesis we must have the multiset equality 
>>> $$\{\{p_2, ..., p_s\}\} = \{\{q_2,...,q_t\}\}$$. 
>>> Finally, as $p_1 = q_1$, we have
>>> $$\{\{p_1, ..., p_s\}\} = \{\{q_1,...,q_t\}\}$$

**Notation** The least common multiple of $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$, denoted $\text{lcm}(x, y)$ or $[x, y]$, is the least positive integers that is a multiple of both $x$ and $y$.

Two (or more) integers are *coprime* or (*relatively prime*) if they don't have any prime factors in common. By [[1.1 Euclid's Algorithm#^bezouts|Bezout's Lemma]], this happens if and only if 1 can be expressed as a linear combination of the two integers. The following two lemmas can be proved using either this characterisation or [[1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic#^ftoa|the fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].  ^a1320f
